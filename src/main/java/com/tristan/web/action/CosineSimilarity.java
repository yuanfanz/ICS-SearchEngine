/**
 * This class calculates the cosine similarity between two clusters, or entities 
 * in our cases. Each cluster consists of one mention at the initialization phase, 
 * because we initialize each mention as a cluster.
 * <P>
 * In the search phase, we need to merge two clusters, each of which contains at 
 * least one mention. So in this way, we need to extract features from the cluster 
 * pairs. We use List to represent the features of each cluster and then compute 
 * the cosine similarity between the feature pairs.
 * <P>
 * The formula to calculate the cosine similarity is borrowed from link:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity
